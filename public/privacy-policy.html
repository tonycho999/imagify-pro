The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

            <li>Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.</li>
            <li>Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Information</h2>
